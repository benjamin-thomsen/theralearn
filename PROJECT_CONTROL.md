## Purpose

This document owns the current verified state of the TheraLearn project.

It answers:

- What is the current phase?
- What has been verified?
- What is currently being worked on?
- What is unresolved?
- What risks or inconsistencies are known?
- Are code changes currently allowed?
- What is the next allowed action?

Stable project identity and permanent principles belong in `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`.
Project governance, authority rules, and documentation navigation belong in `PROJECT_HANDBOOK.md`.
Domain-specific knowledge belongs under `docs/`.

---

## Current Phase

**Domain Documentation Repair and Synchronization**

The historical reconstruction and authoritative project-control kernel are established.

The architecture domain has reached a verified repair checkpoint, and the Foundation documentation domain and its entry point are now established.

The current task is to determine the first detailed Foundation content transfer without re-deriving or duplicating certified methodology.

---

## Current Branch

```text
migration-next16-to-root
```

This branch contains the current reconstructed and verified development state plus the authoritative control, Foundation entry point, and repaired architecture documents.

`main` has not yet been updated with this development history.

---

## Verified Technical Baseline

### Application

- Next.js 16.2.12 is in use.
- TypeScript compilation passes.
- Production build passes.
- 21 application routes/pages are generated or server-rendered by the most recent complete verification.
- A non-blocking `metadataBase` warning remains registered for future resolution.

### Supabase

- Supabase CLI workflow was established.
- MVP database migration exists and was previously pushed to the remote Supabase project.
- Generated database types exist in `types/database.ts`.
- Typed Supabase client/server/proxy integration exists.

### Repository Layer

A repository-layer foundation exists under `lib/repositories/`.

Verified implemented areas include courses, chapters, lessons, flashcards, shared repository types, and shared repository error handling.

`lib/repositories/quizQuestions.ts` is an empty placeholder and must not be treated as completed repository functionality.

### Frontend Transitional State

- Next.js App Router routing/presentation structure is established.
- Global CSS and colocated CSS Modules are in use.
- Reusable UI components exist, but `components/PensumCard.tsx` is an empty placeholder.
- Browser-local quiz progress persists through `lib/progress.ts` and `lib/storage.ts` using `window.localStorage`.
- Supabase/repository persistence exists separately and broad frontend repository adoption is not yet verified.

### CI Verification

- `.github/workflows/verify.yml` runs on push and pull request.
- CI uses Ubuntu, the Node version from `.nvmrc`, `npm ci`, and `./scripts/dev verify`.
- Public Supabase configuration used during verification is supplied through GitHub Secrets.
- This is verified CI behavior and is not by itself evidence of a deployment architecture.

### Developer Toolkit

The Developer Toolkit includes verified workflows for help, documentation check, project verification, project/Git status, file output, edit preparation, replace preparation, clipboard copy, and project search.

The Toolkit launcher automatically copies command output to the clipboard except for the dedicated `copy` command.

The Toolkit implements the workflow; it does not define the project methodology.

---

## Verification State

The most recent complete local verification before documentation repair reported:

```text
Build: PASS
TypeScript: PASS
Documentation structure: PASS
Overall verification: PASS
```

The documentation structure check confirms directory existence. It does not prove that documentation content is complete, current, or authoritative.

The repaired core architecture/control documents and `docs/foundation/README.md` have been re-read from the target GitHub branch after commit.

A new complete local build/TypeScript/documentation verification has not yet been run after these documentation-only changes.

---

## Historical Reconstruction Status

**Status: Methodically complete for current continuation**

The historical review re-established the development chain:

```text
Foundation Design
    ↓
Mechanism Design
    ↓
Foundation Validation
    ↓
Foundation Certification
    ↓
Architecture Derivation
    ↓
Implementation Architecture Derivation
    ↓
Implementation Responsibility Model
    ↓
Completeness Analysis
    ↓
Historical Certification Review
```

The review recovered the permanent methodological principles needed to continue the project.

Known gaps in the reloaded historical evidence include parts of the detailed falsification sequence, including falsification attempt 12 and the full individual history between attempts 20 and 119. The historical certification conclusion reports 120 passed falsification attempts and methodological saturation.

These gaps are currently archival/revision gaps rather than blockers. Historical material should only be reloaded when a specific unresolved Foundation claim requires it.

---

## Authoritative Control Kernel

**Status: Established**

The project has three explicit root control documents:

- `PROJECT_HANDBOOK.md` — governance, authority map, workflow entry point, information lifecycle, and context-recovery procedure;
- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` — stable project identity and permanent high-level principles;
- `PROJECT_CONTROL.md` — current verified state, workflow gate, risks, and next allowed action.

The control kernel remains above domain documentation and does not become the detailed methodology archive.

---

## Foundation Documentation Status

**Status: Domain and entry point established; detailed transfer not yet started**

`docs/foundation/README.md` now establishes:

- the Foundation domain as the permanent home for detailed certified methodology;
- its authority position below the root control kernel and above downstream domain interpretation;
- separation from decisions, references, architecture, product, and development documentation;
- the rule that certified methodology is transferred, not re-derived;
- historical material as targeted evidence rather than default authority;
- a conceptual future ownership map without prematurely creating child files.

No detailed Foundation child document exists yet.

---

## Architecture Documentation Status

**Status: Core architecture repaired; remaining topics classified**

Repaired and verified:

- `docs/architecture/README.md`;
- `docs/architecture/system-overview.md`;
- `docs/architecture/database.md`;
- `docs/architecture/authentication.md`;
- `docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md`;
- `docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md`.

Remaining empty architecture topics have been classified against current evidence and are not to be populated merely to eliminate empty files.

---

## Documentation Audit Findings

The repository still contains significant non-architecture documentation drift.

### Important empty domain files identified

- `docs/product/PRODUCT_VISION.md`;
- `docs/product/LEARNING_MODEL.md`;
- `docs/meetings/decisions-log.md`;
- `docs/development/project-structure.md`;
- `docs/development/git-workflow.md`.

### Damaged or stale documentation identified

- Root `README.md` remains the default Create Next App README and does not describe TheraLearn.
- `docs/development/IMPROVEMENT_BACKLOG.md` contains items marked Planned that have already been implemented.
- `docs/development/DOCUMENTATION_TOOL_ROADMAP.md` understates the current Developer Toolkit implementation state.

### Repository anomalies/placeholders identified

- A root-level file named `-name package-lock.json` exists alongside the normal `package-lock.json`; its origin and relevance remain unverified.
- `lib/repositories/quizQuestions.ts` is an empty placeholder.
- `components/PensumCard.tsx` is an empty placeholder while its CSS Module exists.

No such artifact should be deleted or implemented merely because it has been identified during documentation repair.

---

## Documentation Repair Progress

## Current Risks

### R1 – Domain documentation drift

Implementation and historical decisions are ahead of several non-architecture domain documentation files.

**Mitigation:** continue documentation repair before resuming ordinary feature development.

### R2 – Foundation duplication or reinterpretation during transfer

Detailed certified methodology could be copied into multiple documents, mixed with historical process narrative, or unintentionally re-derived.

**Mitigation:** transfer one ownership unit at a time, identify source evidence before writing, and verify semantic preservation after each transfer.

### R3 – Stale roadmap/backlog state

Tooling documentation no longer fully reflects implemented capabilities.

**Mitigation:** synchronize roadmap/backlog against verified implementation after authority placement is stable.

### R4 – Unverified repository artifact

`-name package-lock.json` may be an accidental historical artifact.

**Mitigation:** inspect before deletion or retention decision.

### R5 – Branch divergence

The authoritative repaired project state currently lives on `migration-next16-to-root`, while `main` remains behind.

**Mitigation:** do not merge or rewrite `main` until documentation consolidation reaches a verified checkpoint and integration strategy is reviewed.

---

## Code Change Gate

**Ordinary product feature development: PAUSED**

Code changes are currently allowed only when necessary to repair documentation/control infrastructure, verify repository state, correct a demonstrated workflow/system defect, or keep documentation tooling aligned with the established workflow.

New product features should not be started until documentation authority and domain synchronization reach a stable checkpoint.

---

## Current Task

Determine the first detailed Foundation ownership unit and its exact evidence requirements before creating any Foundation child document.

The first transfer should begin with the most upstream permanent Foundation model, not with downstream implementation responsibilities or certification history.

---

## Next Allowed Action

Inspect current authoritative root documents for the permanent Foundation v1.0 concepts already preserved there, especially:

- the core problem statement;
- Single Source of Truth / one authoritative home;
- information lifecycle and placement;
- state-transition principles;
- responsibility/authority separation at the high level;
- Runtime/Tooling separation where it is a Foundation-level invariant rather than implementation detail;
- the dependency relationship from Foundation toward derivation and implementation.

Then determine the exact ownership boundary and proposed filename for the first Foundation child document.

Do not create the child document during this inspection step.

Do not reload historical chats unless a specific required permanent claim cannot be established from `PROJECT_HANDBOOK.md`, `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`, `PROJECT_CONTROL.md`, and `docs/foundation/README.md`.

If current authority is sufficient, update `PROJECT_CONTROL.md` with the authorized first Foundation child document and its transfer scope before writing it.

If current authority is insufficient, identify the exact missing claims before requesting targeted historical evidence.

---

## Update Rule

`PROJECT_CONTROL.md` must be updated whenever a verified change materially alters current phase, current task, next allowed action, implementation baseline, verification state, known risks, documentation-repair progress, or code-change permission.

Historical detail should not accumulate here unless it is required to understand the current state.
